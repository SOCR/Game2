<h1>Graph Blitz Instructions</h1>
</b>
<h3><b>Objective:</b></h3>
<p>The objective of this game is to score the most amount of points by
matching the given density curve with its corresponding histograms.</p>
<h3><b>Number of Players:</b></h3>
<p>This game requires 1 player, and is played against the enemy AI</p>
<h3><b>The Gameboard:</b></h3>
<p>A typical gameboard is shown below:</p>
<img src="screenshot.jpg">
<p><b>Board:</b>Shows all of the possible histograms that can be
matched to the density curve
<br>
<b>Current Graph:</b>Shows the current graph whose matches need to be
found
<br>
<b>Timer: </b>Shows the amount of time remaining for the current round
<br>
<b>Score: </b>Shows scores as well as multipliers for both players</p>
<h3><b>Gampeplay:</b></h3>
<p>The first round begins when the current graph is revealed. At this
point, it is the job of both players to find the correct histograms
within the time limit. Once the time limit is reached, the
corresponding histograms are flipped face down, and the next round
begins with a different graph.</p>
<h3><b>Scoring:</b></h3>
<p>Players recieve 1 point per each correct histograms(there are two
correct histograms per graph), and lose one point for each incorrect
histogram. No points are awarded or deducted if nothing is selected.</p>
<h3><b>Multipliers:</b></h3>
<p>Each player is also awarded a score multiplier after each round.
Initially, there is a score multiplier of 1x.
The multiplier is doubled by choosing both of the corresponding
histograms in a round. Choosing an incorrect histogram resets the
multiplier back to 1x.</p>
<h3><b>Endgame:</b></h3>
<p>The game ends when all graphs have been shown</p>
<h3><b>Options:</b></h3>
<p>The following options can be configured before pressing the start
button:
<br>
<b>Number of Graphs:</b> Determines the number of graphs, as well as
the number of rounds to be presented
<br>
<b>Sample Size:</b> Determines the sample size of the histograms
<br>
<b>Game Type: </b>Determines the pool that the graphs will be drawn
from.
<br>
<b>Game speed:</b> Determines the length of each round
